# Dotfiles

Super simple dotfiles based on `zsh`, `zplug`, `brew` with Homebrew bundle, and Karabiner. Includes
some color schemes and other settings and random things as well.

First, install Little Snitch and 1Password (or whatever your password manager is), then run this
simple command:

```
curl --silent https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pzuraq/dotfiles/master/install.sh | sh
```
